Chapter 12 (Web Servers) This will only deal with the communication aspect of the chapter for a presentation
-Hypertext transfer protocol
	- All communication in the web between clients and servers are based on HTTP (HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL)
	- HTTP is basically the client sending a message to the server and waiting for a response
	- HTTP is stateless, meaning it has no clue about the connection and does not need a server to maintain information on its clients
	- HTTP Connections
		- Typically based on TCP. When a client sends a request to a server, it is setup by a TCP connection with the server. This TCP connection is used to obtain a response back from the server.
		  Due to using TCP, HTTP doesn't need to know about the connection (being lost or still up). Both client and server assume the messages make it across. If something has gone wrong (connection
		  time out or error), then it is reported, but no attempt in recovering the data.
		- Old versions of HTTP had issues with inefficient use of TCP connections. 
		- in HTTP 1.0 or older, each request to a server required a separate connection. When the server responded, the connection wa sbroken down. These are known as nonpersistent connections A
		  drawback of nonpersistent connections is the cost of setting up TCP connections. Time to transfer a document to a client is a lot.
		- HTTP does not prevent the client from starting seveal connections simultaneously to the same server. This is to hide latency caused by connection setup time and to transfer data in parallel
		  from the server to the client.
		- HTTP 1.1 made use of persistent connections, which issues several requests for each ((request, response)
	- HTTP Methods:
		- Head: Requests to return the header of a document
		- Get: Request to return a document to the client
		- Put: request to store document
		- Post: Provide data that are to be added to a document
		- Delete: Request to delete a document
		- head operation is submitted tot he server when a client does not want the actual document, but only the metadata
			Ex) using head operation will return the time the referred document was modified. Can be used to verify the validity of the document cached by the client. Check if a document exists 
			    without having to transfer the document
		- Most important HTTP operation is get, and is used to fetch documents from the server to give to the client. Possible to specify that a document should return only if it has been modified
		  (since the user last cached the file). Files can have tags (character strings), and GET files that have a matching tag.
