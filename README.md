# OS_Notes
These notes are for my Operating Systems class and will contain notes on the following textbooks:

 Operating System Concepts, by Avi Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin, and Greg Gagne
 
 AND
 
 Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms, 2nd edition, by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Maarten Van Steen


I will only be including my notes and not the assignments/tests. I will state that my notes mare not be the best and highly recommend reading the books still. I am sharing these notes so students can focus on the reading/lectures instead of writing notes at the same time. I welcome anyone to make corrections to my notes.
